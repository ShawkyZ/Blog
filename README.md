# Jekyll-Bootstrap RTL
Blog Link:  http://shawkyz.info.

This Blog is built on top of Jekyll-Bootstrap https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap/.

Since jekyll-bootstrap is using bootstrap so it was possible to support the RTL with the help of bootstrap-rtl https://github.com/morteza/bootstrap-rtl.
